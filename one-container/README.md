# Pi-Hole + Unbound - 1 Container

## Modifications
This fork contains modifications to the one-container unbound resolver configuration designed to create a long-lived local DNS cache. Most use-cases for unbound involve recursive DNS to get the authoritative response to a DNS query. However, this configuration has been modified so that unbound keeps a large cache with a min-ttl of 3 days (259200 seconds). When a DNS query needs to be resolved outside of the cache, unbound forwards the query to public non-authoritatuive DNS servers. (In my case, my ISP's DNS and Cloudflare DNS as a fallback). 

With authoritative DNS, cached responses return in <1ms and un-cached in ~100-300ms
With forwarded DNS, cached responses return in <1ms and un-cached in ~25ms

Note that this configuration is not ideal for most use cases because the min-ttl is extrtemely high. Consider lowering the min-ttl and allowing prefetches to happen more frequently to keep more fresh records.

## Description

This Docker deployment runs both Pi-Hole and Unbound in a single container.

The base image for the container is the [official Pi-Hole container](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole), with an extra build step added to install the Unbound resolver directly into to the container based on [instructions provided directly by the Pi-Hole team](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/).

## Usage

First create a `.env` file to substitute variables for your deployment.

### Pi-hole environment variables

> Vars and descriptions replicated from the [official pihole container](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#environment-variables):

| Variable | Default | Value | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----- | ---------- |
| `TZ` | UTC | `<Timezone>` | Set your [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) to make sure logs rotate at local midnight instead of at UTC midnight.
| `WEBPASSWORD` | random | `<Admin password>` | http://pi.hole/admin password. Run `docker logs pihole \| grep random` to find your random pass.
| `FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4` | unset | `<Host's IP>` | Set to your server's LAN IP, used by web block modes and lighttpd bind address.
| `REV_SERVER` | `false` | `<"true"\|"false">` | Enable DNS conditional forwarding for device name resolution |
| `REV_SERVER_DOMAIN` | unset | Network Domain | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the domain of the local network router |
| `REV_SERVER_TARGET` | unset | Router's IP | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the IP of the local network router |
| `REV_SERVER_CIDR` | unset | Reverse DNS | If conditional forwarding is enabled, set the reverse DNS zone (e.g. `192.168.0.0/24`) |
| `WEBTHEME` | `default-light` | `<"default-dark"\|"default-darker"\|"default-light"\|"default-auto"\|"lcars">`| User interface theme to use.

Example `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```
FTLCONF_REPLY_ADDR4=192.168.1.10
TZ=America/Los_Angeles
WEBPASSWORD=QWERTY123456asdfASDF
REV_SERVER=true
REV_SERVER_DOMAIN=local
REV_SERVER_TARGET=192.168.1.1
REV_SERVER_CIDR=192.168.0.0/16
HOSTNAME=pihole
DOMAIN_NAME=pihole.local
PIHOLE_WEBPORT=80
WEBTHEME=default-light
```

### Using Portainer stacks?

Portainer stacks are a little weird and don't want you to declare your named volumes, so remove this block from the top of the `docker-compose.yaml` file before copy/pasting into Portainer's stack editor:

```yaml
volumes:
  etc_pihole-unbound:
  etc_pihole_dnsmasq-unbound:
```

### Running the stack

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> If using Portainer, just paste the `docker-compose.yaml` contents into the stack config and add your *environment variables* directly in the UI.
